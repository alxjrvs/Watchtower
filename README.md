#Watchtower

**Martian Manhunter:** Watchtower sensors have picked up the earth tremors from your location. I knew you were on the scene and assumed you could handle it.

##The App
Watchtower is a Rails app that I am making that deails with assignments amongst a group of people. Something done before, yes - but not by me. 

## The Problem 

  I run a website called [Spandexless](http://www.spandexless.com "Spandexless") that reviews Non-Superhero and indie comics and graphic novels. We have gotten a lot of support from indie publishers, and my fantastic Managing Editor [Beth](http://twitter.com/girladactyl "Beth's Twitter") has kept up with our increasing stream of titles. I want to build this so that we can see, at a glance, the state of our books and hound the selfless volunteers that have made us what we are.
    
## The Why
  I plan on using it to experiment with a few parts of rails - Email, for instance, is something I've never done before with rails, and I am intersted in seeing the posibilities and limitations of that system. The innards are fairly usual, but it'll be interesting to see it used in real life application.

## The License 
  Watchtower is licenesed under the MIT Open License. Go Nuts.
